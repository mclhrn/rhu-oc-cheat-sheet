### **Area 1:**

### **Area 2:**
**DevOps, containers, and OpenShift program** 

Containers are changing the way applications are developed, tested, and deployed, and Red Hat® OpenShift Container Platform is how Red Hat does containers.

For organizations that want to speed their application development cycle, containers are a natural fit. However, creating a continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline requires more than containers—it also requires automation. DevOps offers an approach to automation that not only helps link legacy apps with newer cloud-native apps and infrastructure, but does so through fast-paced, iterative IT service delivery.

Our DevOps, containers, and OpenShift recommendations cover the learning needed to succeed in today’s app-hungry world. Earning these four credentials plus one more from the system administrators list can help transform the way organizations deliver applications to their customers.
